This file is a copy of Andrej Karpathy's micrograd code for the youtube video titled "The spelled-out intro to neural networks and backpropagation: building micrograd".
It has all the examples covered in that video.
It has the final version of the code he developed when he explained the examples in video. 
So it may help if we feel stuck and code shown in the video is not runing somehow.
Happy Learning!!!
If any questions, pls reach out to me.
